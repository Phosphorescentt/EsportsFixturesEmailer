# EsportsFixturesEmailer
A simple project to collect esports fixtures/results using PandaScore's API and email them using SendGrid's API.

At present, the configuration for the script is in the root directory as `CONFIG.py`, but this is not included in the repository. If you wish to use this script, you must create your own `CONFIG.py`.
